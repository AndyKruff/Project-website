## 📂 Dataset and System

We used the [Conversational Argument Retrieval dataset](https://github.com/Touché-2020/args.me) from Touché 2020, based on the args.me corpus of Debate.org threads.  

> Dataset highlights:
> - 387,606 arguments across 50 TREC-style topics  
> - For this study: 26 relevant & controversial topics selected  
> - Removed arguments <150 or >3,000 characters  

Our search platform allows:


- **Query submission and reformulation**  
- **Display of top-10 arguments per page** (title + snippet, expandable to full text)  
- **Saving documents** as supporting or opposing a stance  
- **Reviewing saved documents**


> Note: Argument titles were automatically generated using Llama3.

## 🧑‍💻 Data Collection

### Participant Recruitment

- Students of Information Science at a German university  
- Voluntary, anonymous (pseudonyms)  
- Compensated with course credits

### Questionnaires (contained in the repository) 

- **Pre-study:** demographics, socioeconomic background, online activity, search experience, interest rating for 26 topics  
- **Post-study:** stance change, task difficulty rating

### Perceptual Speed Test

Participants completed a modified *Finding A’s Test*:

- Classify character strings for **ε** and **¥**  
- `j` = both present, `n` = not present  
- Time limit: 2 minutes, 30-second practice phase

---

## 🔄 Study Procedure

- Each participant worked on **two topics**: one high-interest, one no-interest  
- Task time limit: 10 minutes  
- Topic order pseudo-randomized  
- Interactions logged: queries, document views, saving, navigation  
- Optional comments collected (original + machine translation)

---

## 🛠 Resources

### Interaction Log Dataset

- 122 sessions, evenly split by topic interest  
- Logged: type, timestamp, session ID, document rank, score, length  
- Stop decisions and reasons recorded

### User Profile Data

- Demographics, search experience, perceptual speed  
- Average perceptual speed: **101.66** (median: 103, SD: 28.51)

## 🚀 Potential Applications


- **Interactive Information Retrieval:** study user behavior in argument retrieval and exploratory search  
- **Personalization & Recommendation:** influence of topic interest & perceptual speed on search strategies  
- **User Modeling:** predict search actions, stopping behavior, or stance selection  
- **Human-Computer Interaction:** evaluate interface designs for search platforms  
- **Educational Technologies:** assess learning and information acquisition strategies

*Figure: Markov model of user interactions. Transitions from states marked with * to **REVIEW** and back were omitted for clarity. Transition probabilities indicated at the arrows and mean interaction times per state are averaged across all sessions. **MARK** and **PAGE** have no actual duration, assigned nominally 1 second.*
